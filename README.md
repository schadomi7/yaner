Yet Another Nix Expression Repository

## Licensing
Reinventing the wheel can be fun at times, especially if your new wheel somhow better suits your problem. But for the most part it is completely unnecessary. Therefore I sometimes take stuff from other repos.

Like from [yarn](https://github.com/yacinehmito/yarn-nix) or from `<nixpkgs>`, both of which are licensed under the MIT license. I am legally obligated to mention this.

This repo is also licensed under the MIT license.
